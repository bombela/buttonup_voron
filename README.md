# Button up your Voron front doors

The stock Voron doors do not always seal fully all around. Especially at higher chamber temperature, the doors start flexing away from the frame even so slightly. Allowing relatively cold ambiant air to flow in, warping big prints.

This mod adds magnets for keeping the door sealed at all time. One part mounts on the frame, the mating part goes on the door. Joined by four pairs of magnets.

With is enough magnets to seal well with those ubiquitous low quality magnets. They start weak, and lose almost all strength beyond 70°C.

With four pairs of 80°C resistant N52 magnets, this makes for a really strong seal. And you might want to only use two pairs of magnets if you find the doors annoying to open!

This mode also comes with handles for a consistant seal all around.

## Printed parts and hardware

All parts to prints are in the folders [STLs/](STLs/) and [STEPs/](STEPs/). You will find variation for 5.8x2.8mm and 6.0x3.0mm magnets for the four parts. As well as various door thicknesses (door + seal) for the part that mounts on the frame.

For the stock Voron2.4 you want the "6.0x3.0magnet_3.5mm_door" variations. I recommend 3 buttonup per doors in addition to the buttonup handles. One button up per corner and one in the middle.

### Per buttonup:

You probably want 6 of them.

 - buttonup_frame ×1.
   - M3x8mm (for 3.5mm doors. Adjust for thicker door) ×1.
   - M3 hammer nut ×1.
 - buttonup_door ×1.
 - VHB tape ~44x13mm ×1.

### For the four handles:
 - buttonup_frame ×2.
   - M3x8mm (for 3.5mm doors. Adjust for thicker door) ×2.
   - M3 hammer nut. ×2.
 - buttonup_handle_a ×2.
 - buttonup_handle_b ×2.
 - VHB tape ~27x13mm ×4.

## Details

The buttonup_frame adds clearance around the doors compared to the stock part. With the exception of the screw, which cannot possibly be moved. This reduces friction.

After ABS shrinkage, the top of the pocket should be about the same diameter as the magnet for a friction fit. Half-way down the pocket, 0.2mm ridges add extra interference for a tight fit.

To make magnet removal easier, the frame part has holes to push them out from the back. The door parts have accomodation for a small flat head screw driver.

For easy identification; before and after printing; the magnet dimensions are written on every parts. And the door size on the frame part.
